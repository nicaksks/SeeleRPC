HOW TO INSTALL SEELE RICH PRESENCE
```
Download the files or compile them. After downloading the files, press the shortcuts: **Windows + R and type: shell:startup**
Place the .exe and .json files inside this folder. Every time Windows starts up, the .exe will be executed. Now that the files are in the correct folder, open the .json and configure it as you wish. Note: You don't need to restart the script to update the Rich presence information.
